# Super-Commerce-Site

Uses PHP and a mySQL database (which is sadly on my college campus) to produce an eCommerce website geared toward superheroes. Users can log in and sessions ensure they can leave the sight and come back with their carts still holding their merchandise. Filters by hero, price, and product name. Sorts by those as well. Secure login and checkout, minus financial transactions which we didn't get to.
